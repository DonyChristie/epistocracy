The goal of the Foundation for Public Betting is to make betting a *universal* human norm by the 22nd century.

If everyone staked resources when they made a truth claim, this means they will actually *care* about the content of what they are saying and how much it reflects reality.

We will start with building a Discord bot for Effective Donyists, and work from there, one step at a time. We want to make it as easy as possible for people to make bets. 

People overestimate how much they can get done in the short-term and underestimate what they can do in the long-term; there is no reason we can't make this a norm if we wait patiently. It's very easy to get started, and the counterfactual epistemic impact could be profound. We will carefully investigate opportunities to make betting Cool As Fuck to the next generations, and make bets on the expected impact of our interventions.

We won't stop until we have a future where truth and reason are the *foundation* of society.
